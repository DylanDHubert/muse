# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Muse Runner game currently has a working core gameplay loop but suffers from several code quality issues, missing dependencies, unused code, and architectural problems that make it difficult to maintain and extend. This refactoring effort aims to clean up the codebase while preserving all existing functionality, improving code organization, fixing TypeScript errors, and establishing better architectural patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be free of TypeScript errors and warnings, so that I can work with confidence and catch real issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN the project is linted THEN there SHALL be no unused variables or methods warnings
3. WHEN properties are referenced THEN they SHALL be properly declared in their respective classes
4. WHEN audio functionality is used THEN the AudioContext SHALL be properly typed and managed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing manager classes to be implemented, so that the game architecture is complete and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the AudioManager SHALL exist and provide note playing functionality
2. WHEN the game handles input THEN the InputManager SHALL exist and manage keyboard state properly
3. WHEN the game manages platforms THEN the PlatformManager SHALL exist and handle platform lifecycle
4. WHEN managers are used THEN they SHALL have proper interfaces and error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused and dead code removed, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN unused methods SHALL be removed or properly integrated
2. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL be used or removed
3. WHEN constants are defined THEN they SHALL be referenced or removed
4. WHEN properties are declared THEN they SHALL be used throughout the class lifecycle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation of concerns, so that each class has a single responsibility and the code is easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game logic is implemented THEN audio concerns SHALL be handled by AudioManager
2. WHEN input is processed THEN input concerns SHALL be handled by InputManager
3. WHEN platforms are managed THEN platform concerns SHALL be handled by PlatformManager
4. WHEN the main game scene runs THEN it SHALL orchestrate managers rather than implement their logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code patterns and naming conventions, so that the codebase is predictable and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN methods are named THEN they SHALL follow consistent camelCase conventions
2. WHEN constants are defined THEN they SHALL follow consistent UPPER_CASE conventions
3. WHEN classes are structured THEN they SHALL have consistent organization (properties, constructor, public methods, private methods)
4. WHEN types are defined THEN they SHALL be properly exported and imported where needed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and defensive programming, so that the game degrades gracefully when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio fails to initialize THEN the game SHALL continue without audio
2. WHEN managers fail to initialize THEN appropriate fallbacks SHALL be provided
3. WHEN invalid input is received THEN it SHALL be handled gracefully
4. WHEN external dependencies are unavailable THEN the game SHALL provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want all existing game functionality to work exactly as before, so that the refactoring doesn't break the gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press S-D-F-G-H-J-K keys THEN platforms SHALL be created at the correct heights
2. WHEN I hold keys THEN platforms SHALL extend as the character moves
3. WHEN I release keys THEN platforms SHALL stop extending
4. WHEN the character moves THEN it SHALL ride the highest active platform smoothly
5. WHEN the character falls too far THEN the game SHALL end appropriately
6. WHEN I score points THEN the score SHALL update correctly
