# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Muse Runner is a rhythm-platformer game for Reddit's Interactive Posts platform where players control an auto-running character by playing MIDI notes on their keyboard. The game combines Guitar Hero-style note timing with platformer mechanics - players must play the correct musical notes to generate platform segments for their character to run on. Missing notes creates gaps that cause the character to fall, ending the game.

The game targets Reddit's Community Play category by incorporating multiplayer elements like shared leaderboards, daily challenges with the same MIDI sequences for all players, and community-generated content.
